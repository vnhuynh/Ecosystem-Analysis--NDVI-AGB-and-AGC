# Ecosystem Analysis
# Generating NDVI, above-ground biomass, and above-ground carbon stock in Python, and can be further analyzed in GIS software. 
# Remote Sensing Analysis for Wetland Ecosystems

Quick & Easy Workflow for Mapping NDVI, Biomass, and Carbon Stock.  
This repository provides tools and a step-by-step guide using QGIS and remote sensing data (Sentinel-2, Landsat, Planet) to:

- Monitor Vegetation Health (NDVI)
- Estimate Above-Ground Biomass
- Calculate Above-Ground Carbon Stock
- Support PES and Ecosystem Monitoring
