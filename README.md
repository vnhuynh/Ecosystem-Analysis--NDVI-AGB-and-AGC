# Ecosystem Analysis  
### Generating NDVI, Above-Ground Biomass (AGB), and Above-Ground Carbon Stock (AGC) using QGIS and Python

This repository provides two pathways to generate NDVI, AGB, and AGC data for marine and wetland ecosystems using remote sensing:

- **QGIS Workflow** 
- **Python Workflow** 

These workflows support vegetation monitoring, ecosystem service mapping, and carbon estimation for PES (Payment for Ecosystem Services) planning.

  A complete step-by-step PDF guide for generating NDVI, biomass, and carbon stock using QGIS’s raster calculator and processing toolbox. 

- **[Python Notebook – NDVI, AGB, and AGC Automation](https://github.com/vnhuynh/Ecosystem-Analysis--NDVI-AGB-and-AGC/blob/main/ndvi-agb-agc-python.ipynb)**  
  A Python script that generates NDVI raster cropping, biomass estimation using NDVI, and carbon stock calculations. Recommended for users who prefer scripting and scalable workflows.
