# QGIS-ndvi-agb-agc
Generating NDVI, above ground biomass, above ground carbon stock in QGIS
#Introduction
This guideline provides step-by-step instructions on how to collect, process, and use remote sensing data for the implementation and monitoring 
In this guide  can generate and interpret three key data outputs: 
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): measures vegetation health, land cover changes and wetland conditions over time
Biomass Estimation (above-ground):  is an indicator of ecosystem health and is also used to quantify above-ground carbon stock
Carbon Stock Estimation (above-ground): Help determine the amount of carbon stored in above-ground vegetation, which is essential for carbon-based PES payments.
