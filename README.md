# Ecosystem Analysis  
### Generating NDVI, Above-Ground Biomass (AGB), and Above-Ground Carbon Stock (AGC) using QGIS and Python

This repository provides two pathways to generate NDVI, AGB, and AGC data for marine and wetland ecosystems using remote sensing:

- **QGIS Workflow** *(no coding required)*  
- **Python Workflow** *(automated, script-based)*

These workflows support vegetation monitoring, ecosystem service mapping, and carbon estimation for PES (Payment for Ecosystem Services) planning.
